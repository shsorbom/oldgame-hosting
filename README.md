# How To Host Old Multiplayer Servers
This Reository aims to be a collection of How-to notes on hosting old GameSpy era servers (~2000-2014). It will rely heavily on using the backend created at https://openspy.net where appropriate. Althogh, it should be noted that a number of fan projects have seperately reverse-enineered the protocol. Those will be referenced too, as appropriate. For ease of deployment, these tutorials will be Wine/Proton-centric.

Most of the games here can be purchased on Steam or GOG.
